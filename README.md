# Porcupine

Porcupine stands for _Portable, Reusable & Customizable Pipeline_. It is a tool
aimed at data-scientists and numerical analysts, so they can express general
data manipulation and analysis tasks in a way (1) that is agnostic from the
source of the input data and from the destination of the end results, (2) that a
pipeline can be re-executed in a different environment without recompiling, by
just a shift in its configuration and (3) that composability is maintained (any
task can always be reused as a subtask of a greater task pipeline).

Porcupine provides three frameworks that work together in that end: _serials_,
_tasks_ and _location trees_.
